<h1>📘 Java DSA Practice – LeetCode, GFG, and More</h1>
Welcome to my Java DSA Practice Repository!
This repo is a collection of solved problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and more — all implemented in Java.
My goal is to improve problem-solving skills, understand core concepts deeply, and build a solid foundation for technical interviews.
